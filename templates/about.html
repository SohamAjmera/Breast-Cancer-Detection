                <h2>Understanding Breast Cancer</h2>
                <p>Breast cancer occurs when cells in the breast grow out of control. These cells usually form a tumor that can often be seen on an x-ray or felt as a lump. Early detection of breast cancer is crucial for successful treatment and improved survival rates.</p>

                <h2>Early Detection Saves Lives</h2>
                <p>Regular screening and early detection are vital in the fight against breast cancer. When breast cancer is detected early, and is in the localized stage, the 5-year relative survival rate is 99%.</p>
